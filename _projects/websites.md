My website is built on top of [Gradfolio](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio) Jekyll template with color and styles adjustments including the footer icons inspired by [Modern Resume](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme).
Aside from my simple Jekyll website, Iâ€™ve created a couple more.

A website about the yearly track cycling cup in Prague. Track cycling is an interesting but dangerous sport itself: I occasionally rode until I slid off and burned my butt. 
The one who took me there, and who requested the website, was the same person: My younger and only brother. 
It prompted me automatically charge him at least double. 

The website was created with React.js because I wanted to practice this [framework/library](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/is-react-a-library-or-a-framework/) on a real-life project as I only encountered it at the university.
I wish I had known Jekyll and other static site generators beforehand for numerous reasons:
GitHub Pages are not particularly friendly with React Router, and my CSS skills were, are, and will always be disastrous.

I spent some good quality time exploring and configuring Webpack and making the bloatware plugins, dependencies, and configurations talk to each other.
Finally, I made a website with reasonably simple custom content management that my not-tech-savvy brother can easily contribute through GitHub.
Nevertheless, I am glad I could finish a React project from scratch by myself.
