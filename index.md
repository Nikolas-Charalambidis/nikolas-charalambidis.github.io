Im in love with Java ‚òï, the Spring ecosystem üçÉ, and everything around microservices architecture, Docker üêã, and automation.

As a result, if it is meaningful, I try to automate or at least include a simple CI pipeline in most of my repositories. Feel free to browse my [GitHub](https://github.com/Nikolas-Charalambidis).

Although backend and integrations still hold a special place in my heart, I'd like to learn more about React or Angular.

Asking and answering questions on the StackOverflow platform helped me to advance. All of my contributions are listed on my [profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3764965/nikolas-charalambidis?tab=profile).

I'm looking for both new opportunities and an open-source project that is well-maintained and well-documented that I can contribute to in my free time.
