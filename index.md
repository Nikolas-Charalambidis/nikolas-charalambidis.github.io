Hi, I‚Äôm Nikolas. Nice to meet you.

I'm in love with Java ‚òï, the Spring ecosystem üçÉ, and everything around microservices, Docker üêã, and automation.

If it's meaningful, I try to automate or at least include a simple CI pipeline in most of my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/Nikolas-Charalambidis).
Asking and answering questions on the StackOverflow platform helped me to advance. 
All of my contributions are listed on my [profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3764965/nikolas-charalambidis?tab=profile).
Although backend still holds a special place in my heart, I'd like to learn more about React or Angular.

I'm always looking for both new opportunities and an open-source project that is well-maintained and well-documented that I can contribute to in my free time. Contact me through my [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nikolas.charalambidis) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolas-charalambidis) accounts.
