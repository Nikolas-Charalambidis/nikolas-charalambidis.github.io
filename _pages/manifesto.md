I believe that each person who's mentally alive has their own unique beliefs, statements and values that define them. 
I'm dedicating this page to the manifestos, projects, and websites that speak to me. 
These have proven helpful not only for myself but more importantly to others. 
For that reason I intend spread awareness about them.

The list is not definitive, and I add more as I go.

## Manifestos

- [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119/): All requirements and technical documentation MUST be clear and unambiguous. RFC 2119 offers a helpful hand.

- [https://semver.org](https://semver.org/): Everybody should follow Semantic versioning or is a monster who loves mess. Period.

- [https://utf8everywhere.org](https://utf8everywhere.org/): The [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoding should be the default choice of encoding.
Notable mentions are [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=ISO_8601/) format and decimal point (ex. `12.34`) as a [decimal separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator#Countries_using_Arabic_numerals_with_decimal_comma).

- [https://nohello.net](https://nohello.net/): Don't say only "hello", ask your question. Alternatively, there is [https://nohello.club](https://nohello.club).

## Projects

- [https://1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1/): The worldâ€™s fastest DNS resolver, which is enough to bypass most network provider restrictions without VPN (some developing countries ban certain news). Though I encourage using VPN anyway.

## Honorable mentions

The following mentions are below the line and outside the IT scope.
Some of them are backed by non-profit organizations (NPO) which I don't want to be associated with.
I mention them because I rather appreciate the methodical approach and attempt to represent negative characteristics by country that are seemingly impossible to quantify and rank.
Though I am aware of the imperfections of the indices, we have to admit they provide a clear picture.

- [https://ground.news](https://ground.news): Though unbiased media don't exist, we can see the whole picture as long as we identify the political bias, factuality, and ownership.

- [Corruption Perceptions Index](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi): Though everybody knows corruption is bad, what do we do?

- [World Press Freedom Index](https://rsf.org/en/index): I am myself lucky to be born and to reside in a very free country. 
I am aware others are not which drives me to not stay ignorant.

- [Global Peace Index](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/maps/#): Again, I find myself lucky to come from a peaceful country.
